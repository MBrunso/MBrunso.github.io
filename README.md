# HYPERMEDIA PART 1: CURRICULUM VITAE
Public link: MBrunso.github.io

## SECTION 1: User
The main user of my page should be employers. People who are looking for new workers for their companies.
It could be also seen by other people with similar experience and searching for other developers to increase their network.

I want them to see my project as a formal, yet personal, curriculum with all information needed to know me. I firmly believe that managers don't want to just look at the person's achievements, but also their goals and expectations for their future.


## SECTION 2: Information Architecture
I classified all the information I wanted to write in general sections (Main page, experience, studies, etc). All the titles are pretty much descriptive of what the user will see when clicking on it.


## SECTION 3: Visual Design

### Color palette
I used one of my favourites color palettes: blue (#0000e6) and white. I complemented it with light blue (#076da4) in the studies table. 
For the smaller details (hovering a link or some thin borders) I used gray (#808080) and light gray (#D3D3D3).

In the hobbies section, I used three color palettes: green (main: #90EE90 and border: #03A203), salmon (main: #FFA07A and border: #FA8072) and yellow (main: #FFFFE0 and border: #FFFF00).

### Typography
I chose Arial as my primary font because I wanted a formal and simple one. It is easy to read and well-known among everyone.

At first glance, I thought of using a diferent font-family for my navbar, but after trying it I didn't really like how it looked, so I used Arial too.

### Layout
Before designing my web, I went through a lot of other people's web CVs. I had no idea what kind of structure fitted me the best. I didn't want a classic CV looking page, so I finally decided to do it like a traditional web page, organising all the data in different static pages.

An horitzontal navigation bar stands out at the top of the screen. Then we have the principal part, the body, where all the information is. Finally, at the bottom, there is a small footer with a link to the contact information.
