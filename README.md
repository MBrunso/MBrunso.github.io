# HYPERMEDIA PART 1: CURRICULUM VITAE

## SECTION 1: User
The main user of my page should be employers. People who are looking for new workers for their companies.
It could be also seen by other people with similar experience and searching for other developers to increase their network.

I want them to see my project as a formal, yet personal, curriculum with all information needed to know me. I firmly believe that managers don't want to just look at the person's achievements, but also their goals and expectations for their future.

## SECTION 3: Visual Design
I used one of my favourites color palettes: blue and white. lalalalal
